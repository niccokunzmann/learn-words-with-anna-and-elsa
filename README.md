# learn-words-with-anna-and-elsa

This tool allows pre-school children to learn new languages on their own

How it Works
------------

There is a Raspberry Pi with a Camera (We can also create an app).
This pi scans QR-codes and reads them out.

What we provide here is:

- printable cards for certain words + generator
- ways to contribute pictures
- sounds from Wiktionary
